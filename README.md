# deliveryCenterTest
a rest api in ruby

use gem to install the required libs

gem install {lib}

run it : ruby api.rb

this is a simple example of a http post request using Httparty
it reads a json file and sends it content

it also saves in a database 
the project already comes with a schema of the used db table in this example 
and you can find it as db.pgsql
you will need to run it and uses its credencials 
that you can find it in db.rb, you may change if you like it
