# deliveryCenterTest
a rest api in ruby

use gem to install the required libs

gem install {lib}

run it : ruby api.rb

test and run it: rspec

This is a simple example of an http post request using Httparty

it reads a json file and sends its contents

It also saves in a database, 
the project already comes with a schema of the used db table in this example 
and you can find it as db.pgsql

You will need to import it and uses its credencials, 
that you can find it in db.rb, you may change if you like it
